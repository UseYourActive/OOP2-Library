/**
 * The {@code Service} interface serves as a common contract for all service implementations
 * within the application. Implementing classes are expected to provide specific business logic
 * related to their designated functionality.
 * <p>
 * Service classes in the application typically encapsulate and manage the business logic
 * associated with specific entities or features. These classes act as a bridge between the
 * presentation layer (controllers) and the data access layer (repositories).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface should adhere to best practices and design patterns,
 * ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability of the codebase.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is recommended to include meaningful and self-explanatory method names, follow the
 * Single Responsibility Principle, and handle exceptions gracefully to promote robustness.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *   public class BookService implements Service {
 *       // Implementation of business logic related to books
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This interface does not enforce any specific methods, allowing flexibility in
 * implementation details. It is up to individual services to define and document the
 * necessary methods based on their requirements.
 * </p>
